# JavaScript Course Notes

This repository documents my JavaScript learning journey, created to support **CTIS 255 – Frontend Web Technologies** at Bilkent University.  
It focuses on building strong fundamentals through documentation-driven learning, experimentation, and independent research.

## Purpose
- Reinforce CTIS 255 coursework with deeper JavaScript understanding
- Develop the habit of reading official documentation and best practices
- Go beyond surface-level tutorials into how JavaScript actually works
- Maintain a long-term reference for future frontend and full-stack projects

## Contents
- Course notes and annotated code examples inspired by Conner Ardman’s JavaScript tutorial series
- Personal experiments and small practice implementations
- Deep dives into JavaScript fundamentals and selected advanced topics

## Exercises
- Practice exercises generated to reinforce concepts
- Custom implementations written to test understanding rather than memorization

## Notes
This repository prioritizes **learning by exploration and documentation**, not just following tutorials.  
I aim to build a solid foundation in JavaScript that will serve me well in future web development.
